## Abstract

Save Knee is an innovative healthcare platform that leverages artificial intelligence to provide accessible knee health analysis and medical consultation services. The system consists of two interconnected mobile applications: a patient-facing app for knee health assessment and a doctor-facing app for professional consultation and patient management. The platform utilizes deep learning models trained on X-ray images to classify knee conditions into three categories: Normal, Moderate, and Severe, achieving 88.40% accuracy. The solution addresses the critical need for early detection of knee problems, reducing healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes through timely intervention. The system integrates real-time chat functionality, secure payment processing, and comprehensive patient-doctor communication channels, making specialized knee care accessible to a broader population.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### Background and Motivation

Knee problems represent one of the most common musculoskeletal issues affecting millions of people worldwide, particularly among aging populations and athletes. Early detection and proper diagnosis of knee conditions are crucial for effective treatment and prevention of long-term complications. However, access to specialized knee care is often limited by geographical constraints, high costs, and long waiting times for appointments with orthopedic specialists.

The integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare has opened new possibilities for democratizing medical expertise and providing preliminary assessments that can guide patients toward appropriate care. Mobile health applications have become increasingly popular, offering convenient access to healthcare services from anywhere, at any time.

### Problem Statement

The primary challenges addressed by this project include:

1. **Limited Access to Specialized Care**: Many patients, especially in remote areas, lack access to orthopedic specialists for knee health assessment.
2. **High Healthcare Costs**: Traditional knee consultations and imaging procedures are expensive and may not be covered by insurance.
3. **Delayed Diagnosis**: Long waiting times for appointments can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, potentially worsening conditions.
4. **Lack of Patient Education**: Patients often lack understanding of their knee health status and when to seek professional medical attention.
5. **Inefficient Doctor-Patient Communication**: Traditional consultation models may not provide continuous support and follow-up care.

### Objectives

#### Main Objective
To develop an intelligent, accessible, and user-friendly platform that provides preliminary knee health analysis using AI and facilitates seamless communication between patients and healthcare professionals.

#### Specific Objectives
1. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Develop and implement a deep learning model capable of classifying knee X-ray images into Normal, Moderate, and Severe categories with high accuracy.
2. **Patient Application**: Create an intuitive mobile application that allows patients to upload knee X-rays, receive AI analysis, and connect with healthcare professionals.
3. **Doctor Application**: Develop a professional interface for healthcare providers to manage patients, review AI analyses, and provide consultations.
4. **Real-time Communication**: Implement secure chat functionality for continuous patient-doctor communication.
5. **Payment Integration**: Provide secure payment processing for consultation services.
6. **Data Security**: Ensure patient data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations.

### Brief Overview of the Proposed Solution

The Save Knee platform consists of two interconnected Flutter-based mobile applications supported by a Python Flask backend with AI capabilities. The system utilizes TensorFlow models for image classification and Firebase for data management and authentication. The patient app provides self-service knee analysis, while the doctor app enables professional oversight and consultation services.
